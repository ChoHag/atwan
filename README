Requirements:

some kind of virtualisation system
centos 6.4 installer dvd 1 or iso in $CENTOS
Lots of free space in $SPACE
A puppet manifest in $PUPPET

With no other virtualisation system to hand, or just to do everything on the
command line, you can use nbsvm.

nbsvm requires lvm. If you don't use it, fake it:

GB=20 # Probably
dd if=/dev/zero of=$SPACE/pv.img bs=$((1048576)) seek=$(($GB*1024-1)) count=1
losetup /dev/loop0 $SPACE/pv.img
pvcreate /dev/loop0
vgcreate vgtmp /dev/loop0

It also needs a bridge to plug into:
brctl addbr brtmp
ifconfig brtmp 10.0.0.1 netmask 24 up
# I think this stuff is right:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -i brtmp -s 10.0.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A FORWARD -i brtmp -o $OUTDEVICE -j ACCEPT # Can be repeated for, eg., eth0 & wlan0
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

If you want a new nbsvm class for this:

cat <<EOF >/etc/nbsvm/attest.class
drive_size=10G
mem=1024
vg=vgtmp
bridge=brtmp
EOF
ln -s nbsvm /usr/local/bin/attestvm


Then onto important stuff:

Build an iso which will create a gold image. All this really does is install a
kickstart script onto the iso which it will use to install a minimal set of
centos packages, and a script on the installed image in /root/initialiser.cron
which it configures cron to run every minute.

mkdir $SPACE/tmp
mkiso-goldimage -o $SPACE/gold.iso -w $SPACE/tmp -r centos-6.4 -u $CENTOS

Then create a gold image vm.
With the attmp class from above:
vnc_port=5901 attmpvm gold newimg start -cdrom goldimage.iso -- vnc

In the console you will need to select the new 'Install an automatic gold
image' option above the default-selected isolinux option.

The gold image is an extremely minimal CentOS which runs a cron script to check
the contents of the cd drive (it would have been usb but vmware doesn't do
virtual usb devices) and run the autorun scripts contained on it (one day these
will be signed and the signatures checked against the key implanted onto the
gold image).

After the gold image there are 2 flavours of initialiser iso, bootstrap and
regular, which are used to give each machine its identity (eventually dhcp will
be supported). The bootstrap iso contains a puppet manifest and runs puppet
apply which sets up the puppet master only (by default). The regular iso does
not include the manifest (and thus is only a few 100 KB) and runs puppet agent.

Apart from this difference, the initialiser iso does whatever else is necessary
to get a puppet client running. For centos-6.4, which is the only thing there's
code for, this means setting up the network, adding the puppetlabs repository
to yum, installing puppet using yum and then running puppet apply/agent.

The puppetmaster is needed first. Networking support is extremely primitive
right now. Change the IP (-i) DNS servers (-d) and gateway (-g) below as
appropriate.

mkiso-initialiser -o $SPACE/init-puppetmaster.iso -w $SPACE/tmp -b -p $PUPPET -r centos-6.4 -n puppetmaster.example.com -i 10.0.0.2 -g 10.0.0.1 -d 10.0.0.1

The -b flag uses a hard-coded ENC script to install just the puppet master. The
regular agent/master communication will then be used over localhost if any
other classes are defined in the real ENC script. If you need to create a
machine which won't have access to a puppetmaster, the -B flag can be used
instead to run puppet with the destination machine's actual manifest, for
example if you need a proxy or package repository set up first:

mkiso-initialiser -o $SPACE/init-proxy.iso -w $SPACE/tmp -B -p $PUPPET -r centos-6.4 -n proxy.example.com -i 10.0.0.42 -g 10.0.0.1 -d 10.0.0.1

A cheap way to clone nbsvm VMs is to take a snapshot of the source:

lvcreate -s /dev/vgtmp/nbsvm-attmp-gold-0 -L 2G -n nbsvm-attmp-puppetmaster-0

Then start the VM with the cd inserted:

vnc_port=5902 mac=52:54:00:10:00:02 attmpvm puppetmaster start -cdrom $SPACE/init-puppetmaster.iso

Alternatively the cd can be inserted to an already-running gold image clone.


After a while the network will be activated. After even more of a while puppet
and puppetmaster will have been installed along with any other classes
specified in the puppet manifest in $PUPPET.


An iso can then be created for each intended vm to give it its identity (see also: dhcp):

mkiso-initialiser -o $SPACE/init-other.iso -w $SPACE -r centos-6.4 -n other.example.com -i 10.0.0.3 -d 10.0.0.1

When a gold image is started with that iso, eventually it will have installed
and run the puppet agent, and a signing request will be waiting on the puppet
master. When signed, this new VM will be puppetised.


The included puppet manifest includes a very boring web server which I haven't
properly tested.

mkiso-initialiser -o $SPACE/init-www.iso -w $SPACE -r centos-6.4 -n www.example.com -i 10.0.0.3 -d 10.0.0.1

vnc_port=5903 mac=52:54:00:10:00:03 attmpvm www start -cdrom $SPACE/init-www.iso

After a while...

On the puppet master: puppet cert sign www.example.com.

After another while...
